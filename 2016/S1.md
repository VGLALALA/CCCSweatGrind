# [Problem S1: Ragaman](https://dmoj.ca/problem/ccc16s1)

## Problem Description

An *anagram* of a string is formed by rearranging the letters in the string. For example, the anagrams of *aab* are *aab*, *aba*, and *baa*.

A *wildcard anagram* of a string is an anagram of the string where some of the letters might have been replaced with an asterisk (*). For example, two possible wildcard anagrams of *aab* are *`*ab`*
and `*b*`.

Given two strings, determine whether the second string is a wildcard anagram of the first string.

## Input Specification

The two lines of input will both consist of N (1 ≤N ≤100) characters. Each character in the first line will be a lowercase letter. Each character in the second line will be either a lowercase letter or an asterisk.

For 8 of the 15 available marks, the second line will not contain any asterisk characters.

## Output Specification

Output the character A if the string on the second line is a wildcard anagram of the string on the first line. Otherwise, output the character N.
