# Problem S3: Phonomenal Reviews


**Problem Description**


Jo is a blogger, specializing in the critique of restaurants. Today, she wants to visit all the Viet-
namese Pho restaurants in the Waterloo area, in order to determine which one is the best.
There are N restaurants in the city of Waterloo, numbered 0 to N -1. However, only M of them are
Pho restaurants. Jo can choose to start at any restaurant. There are N -1 roads in Waterloo, each
road connecting exactly two restaurants. It is possible to reach every restaurant from any restaurant
using these roads. It takes Jo exactly 1 minute to travel along any road.
In computer science, a road network with this structure is called a tree. Here are three examples of
trees

One property that is true for all trees is that there is exactly one path that does not repeat any roads
between any two points in the tree.

What is the minimal length of time that Jo needs to spend on travelling on roads to visit all of the
Pho restaurants?

**Input Specification**

The first line of input contains 2 integers, N and M (2 ≤ M ≤ N ≤100 000).
The second line of input contains M distinct integers indicating the restaurants which are Pho
restaurants.
The next N -1 lines contain 2 integers each. The $i$ th line contains ai and bi, (0 ≤ $a_i$, $b_i$ ≤ N −1),
representing a path between the two restaurants numbered $a_i$ and b

**Output Specification**

Your program should output one line, containing one integer - the minimum amount of time Jo
needs to spend travelling on roads in order to visit all Pho restaurants, in minutes.

**Sample Input 1**

```
8 2
5 2
0 1
0 2
2 3
4 3
6 1
1 5
7 3
```

**Output for Sample Input 1**

3

**Explanation for Output for Sample Input 1**

The path between 5 and 2 goes through 5 →1 →0 →2, which uses 3 roads.

**Sample Input 2**

```
8 5
0 6 4 3 7
0 1
0 2
2 3
4 3
6 1
1 5
7 3
```

**Output for Sample Input 2**

7

**Explanation for Output for Sample Input 2**

If Jo begins at restaurant 6, she will only need to use 7 roads. One possible path that she can take
is: 6 → 1 → 0 → 2 → 3 → 7 → 3 → 4. Notice that she doesn’t need to visit restaurant 5, since
it is not a Pho restaurant. A diagram of the road network is shown below:
