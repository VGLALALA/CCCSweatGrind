**Problem Description**

There are N people sitting at a circular table for a long session of negotiations. Each person
belongs to one of the three groups: A, B, or C. A group is happy if all of its members are sitting

sequence of swap operations. In each swap operation, two people exchange seats with each other.
What is the minimum number of swaps required to make all groups happy?
