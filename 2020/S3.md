# Searching for Strings

**Problem Description**
You’re given a string N, called the needle, and a string H, called the haystack, both of which
contain only lowercase letters “a”..“z”.

Write a program to count the number of distinct permutations of N which appear as a substring of
H at least once. Note that N can have anywhere between 1 and |N|! distinct permutations in total
– for example, the string “aab” has 3 distinct permutations (“aab”, “aba”, and “baa”).

**Input Specification**

The first line contains N (1 ≤ |N| ≤ 200 000), the needle string.

The second line contains H (1 ≤ |H| ≤ 200 000), the haystack string.

**Output Specification**

Output consists of one integer, the number of distinct permutations of N which appear as a substring of H.

**Sample Input**
```
aab
abacabaa
```

**Output for Sample Input**
```
2
```

**Explanation of Output for Sample Input**

The permutations “aba” and “baa” each appear as substrings of H (the former appears twice),
while the permutation “aab” does not appear.
